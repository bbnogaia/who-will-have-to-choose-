# who-will-have-to-choose-
this is the first web application i tried to implement.

The idea is pretty basic: every time i'm with someone there's always a question: 
> "What should we do????"
> "Come on!!! Say something we can dooooo!"
<br>
And every time the answare is
<br>
> "no i don't want to choose nooooo"
<br>
So i decided to code this web application to help people decide!!

There are 3 types of choices based on: where to eat, what to do and what film to watch!

I hope this can be helpful and if you see any possibile improvment don't esitate to contact me!

Byeeeee!
### Happy coding!
