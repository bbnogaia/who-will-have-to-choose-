# who-will-have-to-choose?

Hey there! ðŸ˜Ž

I'm excited to introduce my very first web application! You know how it goes... whenever I'm hanging out with someone, there's always that moment of indecision:

> "What should we dooooo?"
>
> "Come on!!! Suggest something we can dooooo!"

And inevitably, the response is:

> "No, I don't want to choose, nooooo."

So, I came up with a web application to help people make decisions!
Here's how it works: there are three categories of choices: where to eat, what to do, and what film to watch!

I hope you find it helpful, and if you have any suggestions for improvement, feel free to reach out!ðŸ˜‰

See youuuu
### Happy coding!
